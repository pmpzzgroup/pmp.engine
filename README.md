# PMP Engine
## Package for the PMP ZZ Vienna group

We put together this R package to give our team a solid foundation for building portfolio management tools. As portfolio managers, we wanted to create a codebase that we could use and expand on. The package covers the basics of portfolio analysis, so it's a great starting point for our projects.

How to install: make sure you have the package `devtools` installed, then run
## `install_github("pmpzzgroup/pmp.engine")`


Check out all demos and functions via:
## `help(package = "pmp.engine")`
